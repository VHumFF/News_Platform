(30,'The Rise of Youth in Global Politics','the-rise-of-youth-in-global-politics','As political landscapes shift, young leaders are emerging as powerful voices for change. This article explores how the next generation is redefining politics worldwide.','<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In recent years, the global political scene has seen a notable rise in young leaders stepping into the spotlight. From climate activism to social justice movements, youth-driven initiatives are challenging traditional power structures and injecting fresh energy into politics.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Figures like Finland’s former Prime Minister Sanna Marin, elected at just 34, and Chile’s Gabriel Boric, who became president at 35, are examples of how age is no longer a barrier to leadership. These leaders often bring with them more progressive values, a stronger push for environmental policies, and a deeper understanding of digital culture.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Social media has played a key role in this shift. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and Instagram allow young politicians to directly engage with constituents, bypassing traditional media channels. This direct communication has fostered greater transparency and a sense of authenticity that resonates with younger voters.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">However, the rise of youth in politics is not without its challenges.

The world of Teyvat is massive and magical—but also a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing your first powerful allies....','<h3>Summary</h3><ul><li><strong>Skirk in Version 5.7 is expected to be a costly character, requiring a team made up of Hydro and Cryo members.</strong></li><li><strong>The new endgame mode in Genshin Impact will feature a boss gauntlet of six floors, necessitating three teams with millions of HP bosses.</strong></li><li><strong>Skirk will work well with specific characters like Furina and Escoffier, emphasizing her niche role in Freeze gameplay styles.</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A recent&nbsp;<strong><em>Genshin Impact</em></strong>&nbsp;leak has shared a brief overview of what players can expect from Skirk, as well as how the new endgame mode will function. With Version 5.5,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/genshin-impact/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>&nbsp;players were given Natlan\'s second map expansion, two playable characters, and the ability to finally complete Natlan\'s reputation system. Whatever vision HoYoverse had for the Pyro Nation is mostly done, with Mare Jivari being the remaining piece of the puzzle.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Version 5.6 is set to take players back to Mondstadt, as the Archon Quest will bring major figures into the plot, such as Varka, Durin, and the Hexenzirkel. It will introduce Escoffier and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-officially-reveals-ifa-for-version-56/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ifa to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, with the former being a gameplay precursor to Skirk. Escoffier and Skirk are expected to revive Freeze as an Elemental Reaction, albeit with numbers and restrictive teams rather than a true overhaul.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1jydoed/skirk_new_endgame_mode_crumbs_by_homdgrat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">According to HomDGRat</a>, who previously leaked correct details about Escoffier\'s kit before the beta, Skirk is expected to be a very expensive character from an investment standpoint. Namely, the leak describes Skirk being at least 30% weaker if the team isn\'t made from Hydro and Cryo members exclusively.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-leak-skirk-passive-talent-freeze/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Skirk in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em></a>&nbsp;has no off-field abilities, has a simple energy system, and is a single-target hypercarry. Both she and Dahlia are expected to make their debut in Version 5.7, with the latter all but confirmed to be the 4-Star character of the patch.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h2>Genshin Impact: What Do Recent Leaks Mean for Skirk?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/newsplatformimagestorage/uploads/images/a6f021aa-2fdc-41b1-890d-d4fe27bbaa7e_20250416014830.jpg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p>In terms of her preferred team, Skirk will pair well with Furina, Escoffier, and either Yelan or Shenhe. Unlike Varesa or Mavuika, it would seem that Skirk is intended to be rather niche, working well with Freeze, but being wasted in other Cryo playstyles such as Melt. As such, investing in Skirk would mean obtaining Furina and Escoffier to maximize Skirk\'s potential, and given that both are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-chart-most-owned-characters-update-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5-Star characters in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, it would require at least 280 pulls on average.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The other notable information concerns the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/rumor-genshin-impact-leak-new-mode-spiral-abyss/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new endgame in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, which is rumored to be a boss gauntlet of six floors, requiring players to have three teams. However, the leak implies that characters like Neuvillette will be ill-suited for the game mode, as its bosses will have tens of millions in HP. It\'s no secret that HoYoverse has attempted to limit Neuvillette\'s power level since his debut in Version 4.1.&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>&nbsp;players are worried that the new endgame will be used to sell future characters like Skirk, as opposed to rewarding them for properly building a team.

Since the Fontaine era,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/genshin-impact/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>&nbsp;has striven to evolve its endgame loop. For most of its history, the Spiral Abyss represented the only source of challenging content in the game, before Local Legends and the Imaginarium Theater gave players more options to put their favorite characters to the test.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-imaginarium-theater-april-2025-leak/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Imaginarium Theater in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em></a>&nbsp;has especially been a highlight of the Natlan era, despite its introduction in Version 4.7. Concepts such as Visionary Mode and the new Cryo-Dendro reaction have kept the game mode fresh and exciting, especially with the continued release of cosmetic rewards. However, recent combat events in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>&nbsp;have strongly implied that the developers were considering something new altogether.</p><p>Much like the Imaginarium Theater was teased with an earlier combat event, \"Unlimited Fighting Championship\" seems to tease a new endgame mode.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1jwh7b1/new_end_game_content_in_the_future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">According to Seele Leaks</a>&nbsp;and HomDGRat, the developers are testing a new type of Spiral Abyss – six rooms, three teams, and composed entirely of World Bosses.

The southern part of Snezhnaya has been heavily teased since the second half of Version 5.4, and all signs point to fans soon getting a detailed overview of what\'s to come in Version 6.0 and beyond. As for Version 5.6, the Traveler and Paimon will find themselves back in Mondstadt to continue the Archon Quest.

Snehdeep Holy Cross Residential School in Banahappa provides education, healthcare, and a haven for children infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. Launched in 2014 with just 45 students, it now serves 230 children, proving that compassion and perseverance can break barriers.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Mission Rooted in Compassion</strong></p><p>The journey of Snehdeep Holy Cross Residential School began in May 2014, when Sister Britto Madassery, a trained nurse and the school\'s founder, along with her fellow sisters, witnessed the harsh realities faced by children living with HIV/AIDS. During family visits, they realized that many of these children did not go to school due to stigma, financial difficulties, or health issues. Even more troubling, guardians were often indifferent to their welfare, and school dropouts due to medical reasons were common.</p><p>One story deeply moved Sr. Britto—a boy whose parents abandoned him and migrated abroad to escape social stigma. He was later locked in jail, not for any crime, but simply to prevent him from spreading the illness. \"HIV-infected people also have life. Who am I to question and reject them?\" she reflected.</p><p>Another time, she had a vision of Mother Teresa, who said, \"I have come to say goodbye. Now, you take over my work.\" These powerful moments led Sr. Britto to dedicate her life to this cause.</p><p>Determined to act, the sisters held a counseling session on July 9, 2014, for HIV-positive parents and children, conducted jointly by the Jharkhand State Education Project Council (JEPC) and the Snehdeep Holy Cross Community Care Centre. Two months later, on September 23, 2014, the Snehdeep Holy Cross Residential School was established in two small rooms at St. Michael\'s Hearing-Impaired School in Hazaribagh. Initially, it had only two teachers: a counselor, a games teacher, a cook, a guard, and a warden.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Building from the Ground Up</strong></p><p>As the number of children increased, the school had to shift locations six or seven times before settling in Banahappa in 2017. However, the journey was not without struggles. Many people – including religious – looked down on Sr. Britto, with some even refusing to allow her into their rooms, calling her the \"AIDS Sister.\" \"One of my friends said she wouldn\'t allow me to come to her room! They used to say, \'Look, the AIDS sister is coming to beg for food,\'\" Sr. Britto recalled.&nbsp;Procuring land was another major challenge, as government officials dismissed the initiative, stating that these children were of \"no use\" to society.</p><p>But perseverance paid off. A Hindu Swami observing Sr. Britto\'s tireless efforts decided to finance the land for the school. Further support came from Australian Jesuit Fr. Crotty, who helped fund the hostel, and Manos Unidas, who contributed to the school building. The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) stepped in to cover medical expenses, while the Government of India took responsibility for staff salaries, food, and uniforms. CRS also provided medical aid.</p><p>\"When we do God\'s work, He takes care of our needs,\" Sr. Britto often says.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Education and a Future Beyond Stigma</strong></p><p>Snehdeep Holy Cross Residential School provides holistic development opportunities to children living with HIV/AIDS and those of HIV-infected parents. Beyond education, the school ensures children receive proper healthcare, vocational training, and character formation. The institution nurtures each child\'s talents—whether in academics, art, gardening, or sports—and helps them reach their full potential.</p><p>The school offers education up to the eighth grade, but efforts are underway to expand it to the tenth grade. \"I am happy to tell you that our school will soon be up to class 10. Necessary correspondence is being done for this. After class 8, our students go to the nearby government school and complete their studies,\" Sr. Britto shared.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Well-Deserved Recognition</strong></p><p>In September 2024, Sr. Britto was honored with the \"Sustainability of Mission and Ministry\" award at the 81st Annual General Body Meeting (AGBM) at St. John\'s Medical College, Bengaluru, for her dedication to educating and uplifting children affected by HIV/AIDS. The media in Hazaribagh also recognized her work, further highlighting the impact of her mission.</p><p>Sr. Britto belongs to the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy of the Holy Cross, a religious congregation serving in India since 1894. Their mission remains steadfast: \"Urged by the Lord\'s compassionate love, challenged by the needs of the time, and as sharers in the mystery of Christ\'s Death and Resurrection, we commit ourselves to proclaim the Good News and strive for the creation of a new society of wholesome individuals, families, and communities, especially the underprivileged.\"</p>',2,6,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/newsplatformimagestorage/uploads/images/02069a12-1d5f-4e0a-94f1-243bb3521180_20250416021703.jpg',1,'2025-04-16 02:17:05',0,NULL,'2025-04-16 02:17:05','2025-04-16 02:17:05'),

Credit: CMS collaboration/CERN</em></p><p><br></p><h4>A Surprising Signal While Searching for Higgs Bosons</h4><p>CMS researchers were analyzing a large sample of tt-bar production data collected in 2016–2018 to search for new types of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scitechdaily.com/science-made-simple-what-is-the-higgs-boson-god-particle/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(70, 150, 214);\">Higgs bosons</a>&nbsp;when they spotted something unusual. Additional Higgs-like particles are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model. If they exist, such particles are expected to interact most strongly with the singularly massive top quark, which weighs in at 184 times the mass of the proton. And if they are massive enough to decay into a top quark-antiquark pair, this should dominate the way they decay inside detectors, with the two massive quarks splintering into “jets” of particles.</p><h4>A Mysterious Surplus at the Energy Threshold</h4><p>Observing more top-ititop pairs than expected is therefore often considered to be a smoking gun for the presence of additional Higgs-like bosons. The CMS data showed just such a surplus. Intriguingly, however, the collaboration observed the excess top-quark pairs at the minimum energy required to produce a pair of top quarks. This led the team to consider an alternative hypothesis long considered difficult to detect: a short-lived union of a top quark and a top antiquark, or toponium.</p><h4>Quantum Calculations Back the Possibility of Toponium</h4><p>While tt-bar pairs do not form stable bound states, calculations in quantum chromodynamics – which describes how the strong nuclear force binds quarks into hadrons – predict bound-state enhancements at the tt-bar production threshold. Though other explanations – including an elementary boson such as appear in models with additional Higgs bosons – cannot be ruled out, the cross section that CMS obtains for a simplified toponium-production hypothesis is 8.8 picobarns with an uncertainty of about 15%. This passes the “five sigma” level of certainty required to claim an observation in particle physics, and makes it extremely unlikely that the excess is just a statistical fluctuation.</p><p><br></p><h4>Could Toponium Complete the Quarkonium Puzzle?</h4><p>If the result is confirmed, toponium would be the final example of quarkonium – a term for unstable quark-antiquark states formed from pairings of the heavier charm, bottom, and perhaps top quarks. Charmonium (charm–anticharm) was discovered simultaneously at Stanford National Accelerator Laboratory in California and Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cerncourier.com/a/the-new-particles/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(70, 150, 214);\">November Revolution</a>&nbsp;in particle physics of 1974. Bottomonium (bottom–antibottom) was discovered at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois in 1977. Charmonium and bottomonium are approximately 0.6 and 0.4 femtometres in size respectively, where one femtometre is a millionth of a nanometre. Bottomonium is thought to be the smallest hadron yet discovered. Given its larger mass, toponium is expected to be far smaller – qualifying it as the smallest known hadron.</p><h4>Why Toponium Was Thought Impossible to Detect</h4><p>For a long time, it was thought that toponium bound states were unlikely to be detected in hadron-hadron collisions. The top quark decays into a bottom quark and a W boson in the time it takes light to travel just 0.1 femtometre – a fraction of the size of the particle itself.

She was advocating for institutional reform, not personal criticism.</p><p>Under the current system, although the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) is tasked with identifying and recommending candidates, the prime minister retains overriding power in the final selection.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints judicial officers based on the prime minister’s advice, effectively giving the head of government substantial influence over the judiciary.</p><p>Maimun’s call, far from being politically motivated, reflects a long-standing concern among legal scholars and reform advocates: the need to uphold judicial independence and safeguard the separation of powers. These are not new concerns. They are embedded in the broader debate about governance, accountability, and democratic maturity in Malaysia.</p><p>Nazri, however, took issue with the Chief Justice’s remarks, suggesting that as a civil servant nearing retirement, she should not politicise the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>He also claimed that existing checks and balances are sufficient, and that the prime minister’s dominant role is justified because he is an elected leader entrusted by Parliament.</p><p>This argument, though familiar, is no longer tenable in light of modern democratic norms.&nbsp;</p><p>In an era where transparency and independence of institutions are paramount, the concentration of power, especially in appointments to the judiciary, poses a risk to the doctrine of separation of powers. The judiciary must not only be independent, but also be seen to be independent.</p><p>More curiously, Nazri’s reaction suggests he was defending Anwar personally. Yet, Maimun was clearly referring to the institutional role of the prime minister in the appointment process, not to any specific individual.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Even if her remarks were indirectly aimed at the current administration, they are justified. After all, it was Anwar himself, long before becoming prime minister, who spoke about institutional reform and the depoliticisation of state apparatuses, including the judiciary.</p><p>Nazri may see his defence of Anwar as necessary, but in doing so, he downplays the importance of a critical self-examination of our institutions. His claim that Maimun should have waited for a better time to make her concerns known is disingenuous. If not now, when?</p><p>If anything, Maimun should be lauded for speaking out especially in a climate where many in the public service shy away from addressing structural deficiencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Her insights, shaped by years of experience at the highest levels of the judiciary, carry more weight than the rhetoric of political loyalty.</p><p>Nazri’s criticisms miss the broader point. The judiciary must be shielded from political influence, not just in theory, but in practice. Suppressing calls for reform only entrenches the very weaknesses that undermine public confidence in our institutions.</p><p>If Malaysia is to progress toward genuine democratic governance, critical perspectives such as Maimun’s should be welcomed, not silenced. In an otherwise moribund bureaucracy, her voice is a rare and necessary breath of fresh air.</p><p><em>P Ramasamy is the former deputy chief minister of Penang and chairman of Urimai.</em></p>',2,10,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/newsplatformimagestorage/uploads/images/9359bdb0-e136-4084-90ba-cc82c675b4f8_20250416022305.jpg',1,'2025-04-16 02:23:07',21,NULL,'2025-04-16 02:23:07','2025-04-16 02:23:07'),
